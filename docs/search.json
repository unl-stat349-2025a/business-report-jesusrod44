    "text": "Tornadoes that form over water (also known as “Waterspouts”) in shark-infested waters, that also move inwards towards land, do not have the potential to carry sharks over towards mainland cities to cause a disruption similar to the movie ‘Sharknado’.\nWhen plotting the data for sharks and waterspouts, it is apparent that waterspouts are not a common occurrence ( at least in the past five years ). These waterspouts have not caused any major damage to property or crops, and no deaths or injuries have been recorded, they either do not possess the strength to do so and many of these waterspouts do not last longer than an hour. The most action that has happened has been an incident where a waterspout damaged two vehicles and a power line, causing $5000 in damages. But when compared to tornadoes, this is very minuscule. This clearly shows that tornadoes that form on water lack the power necessary to lift sharks. In a perfect world, the better way to compare power is to compare levels on the Tor EF Scale. The scale that ranks how strong a tornado is from EF1 to EF5. However, waterspouts are not considered tornadoes and they do not have a power scale similar to tornadoes.\n\nggplot(property_damage_summary, aes(x = EVENT_TYPE, y = Average_Property_Damage)) + geom_col() + labs( title = \"Average Property Damage by Tornadoes and Waterspouts 2020-2024\", x = \"Event Type\", y = \"Cost of Damage ($)\", tag= \"Figure 1\", caption = 'Waterspouts are very weak when compared to tornadoes. Their average in property damage is a $7.96.') + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTornadoes that are strong enough to carry the weight of sharks do not typically form near the coasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved Proportion of EF4 tornadoes: 0.0021 \n\n\nObserved Percentage of EF4 tornadoes: 0.21 %\n\n\nUnder the assumption that if an EF4 or EF5 tornado forms near the coast, they will become sharknados, the likelihood that would happen is very low\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0\n\n\n[1] 0.008071882\n\n\nOne-tailed p-value: 0 \n\n\nGiven these very specific conditions: sharks are swimming close to the surface of the ocean. An EF5 tornado is the only tornado would be needed to carry sharks such as the hammerhead, tiger, and white shark. Given that there is no EF5 tornado observed in the data and EF4 tornadoes are also known to launch cars a considerable distance, we can assume that EF4 tornadoes will become sharknados when formed near the coast.\nAssuming each tornado is independent of each other, and there EF scales are identically distributed, meaning that the relationship between EF scale and location is random. A bootstrap sample can be done to test that the probability of an EF4 tornado forming on the coast will happen at random, meaning that there is a chance that a tornado powerful enough to carry sharks (given the right conditions) will theoretically happen at random.\nA null hypothesis of Ho: p = 0.20 is made. This null states that the probability of a EF4 tornado is equal to 20%, that also means all 5 categories have an equal chance of occurring. An alternative hypothesis states Ha: p &lt; 0.20, meaning the chance of a tornado being an EF4 tornado on the coast is less than 0.20.\nThe observed proportion of EF4 tornadoes in our data is 0.0021 meaning, that in our observed sample, it is very unlikely for EF4 tornadoes to form near the coast. When bootstrapping, a bootstrapped observed proportion of EF4 tornadoes is 0.0080719. The tells us that the probability of our observation happening at random is approaching very closely to 0.\nWe do not have enough evidence to say that these EF4 and EF5 tornadoes appear on the coasts at random, so we must reject that idea and can confirm that it is not likely that tornadoes with the potential to cause shark-infested terror will be a threat people should be worried about in the future.",

Modern tornado data is more valuable to be analyzed in this report due to modern weather trends. So, even with NOAA offering data recorded starting from the year 1950, only current data was implemented to be analyzed.\n\n4.3.1 Cleaning Tornado Data\nThe storm events included in this dataset ranged from avalanches to thunderstorms. Due to interest only being in the events: Tornadoes and Waterspouts, all other unneccessary events were filtered out and removed from the data. These two events were then categorized in their own dataset.\nIn the waterspout dataset, the latter, less powerful fair weather waterspouts were removed in order to evaluate tornadic waterspouts. For this to be done, in the data’s ‘Event Narrative’ columns, where they include a brief summary on the event, only cases where the string “tornad” were selected, as this string would keep observations that discussed waterspouts that either: Were tornadic waterspouts or transformed into tornadoes.\nFor the filtered tornado dataset, observations where the EF Score of a tornado was “EFU” meaning unknown were removed in order to keep tornadoes with a properly rated EF Scale.\nIn both filtereed datasets, rows wth ‘NA’ values in thier beginning and ending latitude and longitude values were excluded.",

Therefore, an oversimplified way to check how much damage they are capable of is to look at the average cost of property each event has caused in our sample.\nThe following data wrangling was needed in order to get a clean chart comparing the averages. The data’s property damage column was formatted as 100K or 1M, meaning $100,000 and $1,000,000. To combat this, rows with the letters K or M in the “DAMAGE_PROPERTY” column were multiplied by 1000 and 10000000.

The tornado points were transformed into spatial data via st_transform() from the ‘sf’ package.

This gives us a p-value of 0.2 (There are 5 values and each appear evenly). Under this assumption, 1000 bootstrap samples were taken. At first, the points were filtered out to only include coastal tornadoes, but this process made the rendering unbearably long. Therefore, it was commented out, and we assume that the 473 observations sampled each time in 1 bootstrap sample are the coastal tornadoes. This is because if each data point is having their EF scale randomized with replacement, the points will not be of importance, rather the proportion of the amount of times an EF4 or EF5 tornado appears in a bootstrap sample is more important. A problem with this is there are no EF5 tornadoes in our data, but this is discussed as well later.\nA histogram is made to show the distribution of the bootstrapped proportions, with a red dashed line showing the null p-value of 0.2. To see if our observed probability is based off random chance under the null,the mean of all the bootstrapped proportions is compared against the null p-value. If a p-value below 0.05 is recorded, we have enough evidence to reject the null and say EF4 and EF5 tornadoes are very unlikely to occur on the coasts of America.",

While on the other end of the spectrum, EF5 tornadoes can promise wind speeds that can decimate well built homes and infrastructure. These tornadoes can carry objects like cars with no trouble. An EF2 tornado is where we finally see enough force for winds to pick up a small car around 2000lbs, but not enough force for it to be thrown wildly. In the center, an EF3 tornado can remove the roofs off buildings on uproot small trees. An EF4 tornado is where we finally begin to see heavy objects such as trucks, cars, and semis be thrown around considerable distances.\nAn EF5 tornado will for sure have the potential to be a sharknado, and another contender is the EF4 tornado and maybe, if the conditions are just right, an EF3 tornado might be able to, however, this is being very generous. Our sharknado would realistically have to be a category EF5 or EF4 tornado in order to cause terror similar to the film.\n\n3.3.1 Tornado or Waterspout?\nThis sharknado would need to have a tornado that forms over shark infested waters. A tornado that forms over water is usually classified as a waterspout. Waterspouts are not classified as tornadoes, so they are not given a score on the EF scale. If a waterspout moves on shore however, The National Weather Service classifies it as a tornado and issues a tornado warning for the area.\nWaterspouts are generally broken into two categories: fair weather waterspouts and tornadic waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts to put it simply are a less dangerous event that form during relatively calm weather and are not associated with thunderstorms. The phenonema of interest are tornadic waterspouts. These have the same characteristics of a land tornado, they are often accompanied by high winds, severe thunderstorms, large hail. It is essentially a tornado that forms over water, but it can also form by a tornado moving from land to water. If a sharknado would occur this is how it would form!\n\n\n3.3.2 Sharks in Waters in the United Sates\nSharks are found in coastal waters along the East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbeans. These waters are where a sharknado would have to form.\nSharks vary greatly in size and weight.

    "text": "The Sharknado film series takes the idea of tornadoes picking up marine life to a dramatic extreme. While there has not been a documented case of a tornado hurling sharks onto land, we explored whether such an event is even scientifically plausible. We examined whether powerful tornadoes could form over or near coastal shark-infested waters, lift sharks into the air, and carry them inland.\nTo assess the likelihood of a tornado capturing sharks within its vortex and terrorizing the public, we analyzed tornado data from 2020 to 2024 and shark population data near U.S. coastlines, particularly around the Gulf of Mexico. We defined three key conditions that are required for a Sharknado to occur: (1) a tornado must be strong enough to lift a shark, (2) it must form over or near shark-inhabited waters, and (3) it must move inland.\nOur findings indicate that waterspouts, tornadoes that form over water, are generally weaker than their land-based counterparts and are unlikely to lift large animals such as sharks. On the other hand, stronger tornadoes typically do not form directly over water or in close proximity to shark habitats. The two types of tornadoes with the potential to lift sharks from the water are EF4 and EF5 tornadoes given the very specific conditions that sharks are near the surface of the water. Assuming that if tornadoes form relatively near the coasts of the United States and shark-inhabited waters, the observed probability of EF4 and EF5 tornadoes forming on the coast is 0.0021. When bootstrapping under the assumption that each scale of tornado has an equal chance of happening ( Null: p = 0.2 ), we get an observed bootstrap average of 0.008.\n\nTherefore, while the Sharknado scenario remains a thrilling fictional concept, the probability of such an event occurring any time soon in real life is extremely low.",

Waterspouts do tend to form in shark infested waters, but these are not powerful enough to lift sharks that can weight up to 2400 lbs and relocate them to land. From the more powerful of the two types of waterspouts, tornadic waterspouts’ power are limited and never seem to make landfall.\n\n6.1.1 There is a Little Amount of Tornadoes with a High Enough EF Score that form near the coasts\nTornadoes that do form near the coasts typically have an EF rating of EF2 or lower. An EF2 tornado has the power to lift a car and move it a ways from where it was, but when trying to find the possibility of lifting sharks throughout a city, a stronger EF4 tornado is very well needed to pull the sharks from the depths of the water. Although there are some EF3 tornadoes present in Florida, and EF3 tornadoes could pick up a car and throw them a considerable distance, the chance that sharks are swimming near the surface of the water to be pulled into the vortex is low. There is an EF4 tornado located in Georgia, however this tornado is not close enough to the ocean coasts that it would be able to make contact with the sharks present there.",

    "text": "6.3 Limitations in Data and Knowledge\n\n6.3.1 No Free Shark Survey Dataset (From a Trusted Source) that Has Observations on the West Coast or Northeast of America\nAlthough our data showed that tornadic waterspouts and tornadoes that form near the coasts of America do not form too often and are not that powerful, there was not much comparison when plotting those events against sharks surveyed or spotted outside of the Southeast or Hawaii. Data for California was found, however that was not survey or tracking data, rather it was shark incident data. This leads to more sharks being plotted in places that have more people, preventing an evenly distribution of shark points on the map. Due to this limitation, our interpretation can only be justified that people on the coasts of the Southeast region of America near the Gulf of Mexico, Hawaii, and California.\n\n\n6.3.2 Bootstrapping\nOur probability observed from our bootstrapped sample of 0.008, only tells us that if the EF scales of the tornadoes in our dataset were randomized, and they were measured on the tornadoes near the coasts, that is the long run proportion of EF4 and EF5 tornadoes that will form near the coasts. However, the way the coastal data is set up, these tornadoes can be technically in the coastal region plotted, but be too far away from the coastline to be able to cause havoc with sharks. Our bootstrap probability is then not really the true average amount of tornadoes that would be able to lift sharks, and in reality it could be greater or it could be less.\n\n\n6.3.3 Hurricanes?\nIn this report, only tornadoes were considered. This can be a bit problematic when looking at a place like Hawaii. There are very little tornadoes recorded in Hawaii, yet a lot of sharks. It could be argued, that a hurricane of great strength could be enough to lift the numerous sharks surrounding Hawaii, but in as stated previous, we are not interested in Shark-icanes.\n\n\n6.3.4 Comparing Tornadoes and Waterspouts\nWaterspouts do not have any classification of power similar to tornadoes. In order to compare the differences in power between the two, the observed damage to property was looked at. A problem with this is that waterspouts will most likely be less damaging as they are not near much property at all when forming. This caused the averages to be compared instead, but there is still some limitations on how far the implication of just how strong waterspouts can be. It is clear though, that the greatest waterspouts, were still not able to match the power of tornadoes with a score of EF2 or higher.",

    "text": "C Results\nTornadoes that form over water (also known as “Waterspouts”) in shark-infested waters, that also move inwards towards land, do not have the potential to carry sharks over towards mainland cities to cause a disruption similar to the movie ‘Sharknado’.\nWhen plotting the data for sharks and waterspouts, it is apparent that waterspouts are not a common occurrence ( at least in the past five years ). These waterspouts have not caused any major damage to property or crops, and no deaths or injuries have been recorded, they either do not possess the strength to do so and many of these waterspouts do not last longer than an hour. The most action that has happened has been an incident where a waterspout damaged two vehicles and a power line, causing $5000 in damages. But when compared to tornadoes, this is very minuscule. This clearly shows that tornadoes that form on water lack the power necessary to lift sharks. In a perfect world, the better way to compare power is to compare levels on the Tor EF Scale. The scale that ranks how strong a tornado is from EF1 to EF5. However, waterspouts are not considered tornadoes and they do not have a power scale similar to tornadoes.\n\nggplot(property_damage_summary, aes(x = EVENT_TYPE, y = Average_Property_Damage)) + geom_col() + labs( title = \"Average Property Damage by Tornadoes and Waterspouts 2020-2024\", x = \"Event Type\", y = \"Cost of Damage ($)\", tag= \"Figure 1\", caption = 'Waterspouts are very weak when compared to tornadoes. Their average in property damage is a $7.96.') + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTornadoes that are strong enough to carry the weight of sharks do not typically form near the coasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved Proportion of EF4 tornadoes: 0.0021 \n\n\nObserved Percentage of EF4 tornadoes: 0.21 %\n\n\nUnder the assumption that if an EF4 or EF5 tornado forms near the coast, they will become sharknados, the likelihood that would happen is very low\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] 0\n\n\n[1] 0.008071882\n\n\nOne-tailed p-value: 0 \n\n\nGiven these very specific conditions: sharks are swimming close to the surface of the ocean. An EF5 tornado is the only tornado would be needed to carry sharks such as the hammerhead, tiger, and white shark. Given that there is no EF5 tornado observed in the data and EF4 tornadoes are also known to launch cars a considerable distance, we can assume that EF4 tornadoes will become sharknados when formed near the coast.\nAssuming each tornado is independent of each other, and there EF scales are identically distributed, meaning that the relationship between EF scale and location is random. A bootstrap sample can be done to test that the probability of an EF4 tornado forming on the coast will happen at random, meaning that there is a chance that a tornado powerful enough to carry sharks (given the right conditions) will theoretically happen at random.\nA null hypothesis of Ho: p = 0.20 is made. This null states that the probability of a EF4 tornado is equal to 20%, that also means all 5 categories have an equal chance of occurring. An alternative hypothesis states Ha: p &lt; 0.20, meaning the chance of a tornado being an EF4 tornado on the coast is less than 0.20.\nThe observed proportion of EF4 tornadoes in our data is 0.0021 meaning, that in our observed sample, it is very unlikely for EF4 tornadoes to form near the coast. When bootstrapping, a bootstrapped observed proportion of EF4 tornadoes is 0.0080719. The tells us that the probability of our observation happening at random is approaching very closely to 0.\nWe do not have enough evidence to say that these EF4 and EF5 tornadoes appear on the coasts at random, so we must reject that idea and can confirm that it is not likely that tornadoes with the potential to cause shark-infested terror will be a threat people should be worried about in the future.",

There have been circumstances where tornadoes have picked up animals such as fish and frogs, if one’s imagination is not limited, one could see it be possible for tornadoes to carry sharks.

While on the other end of the spectrum, EF5 tornadoes can promise wind speeds that can decimate well built homes and infrastructure. These tornadoes can carry objects like cars with no trouble. An EF2 tornado is where we finally see enough force for winds to pick up a small car around 2000lbs, but not enough force for it to be thrown wildly. In the center, an EF3 tornado can remove the roofs off buildings on uproot small trees. An EF4 tornado is where we finally begin to see heavy objects such as trucks, cars, and semis be thrown around considerable distances.\nAn EF5 tornado will for sure have the potential to be a sharknado, and another contender is the EF4 tornado and maybe, if the conditions are just right, an EF3 tornado might be able to, however, this is being very generous. Our sharknado would realistically have to be a category EF5 or EF4 tornado in order to cause terror similar to the film.\n\nD.3.1 Tornado or Waterspout?\nThis sharknado would need to have a tornado that forms over shark infested waters. A tornado that forms over water is usually classified as a waterspout. Waterspouts are not classified as tornadoes, so they are not given a score on the EF scale. If a waterspout moves on shore however, The National Weather Service classifies it as a tornado and issues a tornado warning for the area.\nWaterspouts are generally broken into two categories: fair weather waterspouts and tornadic waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts to put it simply are a less dangerous event that form during relatively calm weather and are not associated with thunderstorms. The phenonema of interest are tornadic waterspouts. These have the same characteristics of a land tornado, they are often accompanied by high winds, severe thunderstorms, large hail. It is essentially a tornado that forms over water, but it can also form by a tornado moving from land to water. If a sharknado would occur this is how it would form!\n\n\nD.3.2 Sharks in Infested Waters in the United Sates\nSharks are found in coastal waters along the East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbeans. These waters are where a sharknado would have to form.\nSharks vary greatly in size and weight.

    "text": "E.1 Tornadic Waterspouts Powerful Enough to Carry Sharks And Makes Landfall is an Unlikely Event\nKey findings suggest that a sharknado is not likely to occur. Waterspouts do tend to form in shark infested waters, but these are not powerful enough to lift sharks that can weight up to 2400 lbs and relocate them to land. From the more powerful of the two types of waterspouts, tornadic waterspouts’ power are limited and never seem to make landfall.\n\nE.1.1 There is a Little Amount of Tornadoes with a High Enough EF Scale that form near the coasts\nTornadoes that do form near the coasts typically have an EF rating of EF2 or lower. An EF2 tornado has the power to lift a car and move it a ways from where it was, but when trying to find the possibility of lifting sharks throughout a city, a stronger EF4 tornado is very well needed to pull the sharks from the depths of the water. Although there are some EF3 tornadoes present in Florida, and EF3 tornadoes could pick up a car and throw them a considerable distance, the chance that sharks are swimming near the surface of the water to be pulled into the vortex is low. There is an EF4 tornado located in Georgia, however this tornado is not close enough to the ocean coasts that it would be able to make contact with the sharks present there.",

    "text": "E.3 Limitations in Data and Knowledge\n\nE.3.1 No Free Shark Survey Dataset (From a Trusted Source) that Has Observations on the West Coast or Northeast of America\nAlthough our data showed that tornadic waterspouts and tornadoes that form near the coasts of America do not form too often and are not that powerful, there was not much comparison when plotting those events against sharks surveyed or spotted outside of the Southeast or Hawaii. Data for California was found, however that was not survey or tracking data, rather it was shark incident data. This leads to more sharks being plotted in places that have more people, preventing an evenly distribution of shark points on the map. Due to this limitation, our interpretation can only be justified that people on the coasts of the Southeast region of America near the Gulf of Mexico, Hawaii, and California.\n\n\nE.3.2 Bootstrapping\nOur probability observed from our bootstrapped sample of 0.008, only tells us that if the EF scales of the tornadoes in our dataset were randomized, and they were measured on the tornadoes near the coasts, that is the long run proportion of EF4 and EF5 tornadoes that will form near the coasts. However, the way the coastal data is set up, these tornadoes can be technically in the coastal region plotted, but be too far away from the coastline to be able to cause havoc with sharks. Our bootstrap probability is then not really the true average amount of tornadoes that would be able to lift sharks, and in reality it could be greater or it could be less.\n\n\nE.3.3 Hurricanes?\nIn this report, only tornadoes were considered. This can be a bit problematic when looking at a place like Hawaii. There are very little tornadoes recorded in Hawaii, yet a lot of sharks. It could be argued, that a hurricane of great strength could be enough to lift the numerous sharks surrounding Hawaii, but in as stated previous, we are not interested in Shark-icanes.\n\n\nE.3.4 Comparing Tornadoes and Waterspouts\nWaterspouts do not have any classification of power similar to tornadoes. There in order to compare the differences in power between the two, the observed damage to property was looked at. A problem with this is that waterspouts will most likely be less damaging as they are not near much property at all when forming. This caused the averages to be compared instead, but there is still some limitations on how far the implication of just how strong waterspouts can be.",

    "text": "The Sharknado film series takes the idea of tornadoes picking up marine life to a dramatic extreme. While there has not been a documented case of a tornado hurling sharks onto land, we explored whether such an event is even scientifically plausible. We examined whether powerful tornadoes could form over or near coastal shark-infested waters, lift sharks into the air, and carry them inland.\nTo assess the likelihood of a tornado capturing sharks within its vortex and terrorizing the public, we analyzed tornado data from 2020 to 2024 and shark population data near U.S. coastlines, particularly around the Gulf of Mexico. We defined three key conditions that are required for a Sharknado to occur: (1) a tornado must be strong enough to lift a shark, (2) it must form over or near shark-inhabited waters, and (3) it must move inland.\nOur findings indicate that waterspouts, tornadoes that form over water, are generally weaker than their land-based counterparts and are unlikely to lift large animals such as sharks. On the other hand, stronger tornadoes typically do not form directly over water or in close proximity to shark habitats. The two types of tornadoes with the potential to lift sharks from the water are EF4 and EF5 tornadoes given the very specific conditions that sharks are near the surface of the water. Assuming that if tornadoes form relatively near the coasts of the United States and shark-inhabited waters, the observed probability of EF4 and EF5 tornadoes forming on the coast is 0.0021. When bootstrapping under the assumption that each scale of tornado has an equal chance of happening ( Null: p = 0.2 ), we get an observed bootstrap average of 0.008.\n\nTherefore, while the Sharknado scenario remains a thrilling fictional concept, the probability of such an event occurring any time soon in real life is extremely low.",

An EF2 tornado is where we finally see enough force for winds to pick up a small car around 2000lbs, but not enough force for it to be thrown wildly. In the center, an EF3 tornado can remove the roofs off buildings on uproot small trees. An EF4 tornado is where we finally begin to see heavy objects such as trucks, cars, and semis be thrown around considerable distances.\nAn EF5 tornado will for sure have the potential to be a sharknado, and another contender is the EF4 tornado and maybe, if the conditions are just right, an EF3 tornado might be able to, however, this is being very generous. Our sharknado would realistically have to be a category EF5 or EF4 tornado in order to cause terror similar to the film.",

Waterspouts are not classified as tornadoes, so they are not given a score on the EF scale. If a waterspout moves on shore however, The National Weather Service classifies it as a tornado and issues a tornado warning for the area.\nWaterspouts are generally broken into two categories: fair weather waterspouts and tornadic waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts to put it simply are a less dangerous event that form during relatively calm weather and are not associated with thunderstorms. The phenonema of interest are tornadic waterspouts. These have the same characteristics of a land tornado, they are often accompanied by high winds, severe thunderstorms, large hail. It is essentially a tornado that forms over water, but it can also form by a tornado moving from land to water. If a sharknado would occur this is how it would form!",
