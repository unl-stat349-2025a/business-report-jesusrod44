    "text": "5.1 Tornadoes that form over water (also known as “Waterspouts”) in shark-infested waters, that also move inwards towards land, do not have the potential to carry sharks over towards mainland cities to cause a disruption similar to the movie ‘Sharknado’\nWhen plotting the data for sharks and waterspouts, it is apparent that waterspouts are not a common occurrence ( at least in the past five years ). These waterspouts have not caused any major damage to property or crops, and no deaths or injuries have been recorded, they either do not possess the strength to do so and many of these waterspouts do not last longer than an hour. The most action that has happened has been an incident where a waterspout damaged two vehicles and a power line, causing $5000 in damages. But when compared to tornadoes, this is very minuscule (See Figure 1). This clearly shows that tornadoes that form on water lack the power necessary to lift sharks.\nIn a perfect world, the better way to compare power is to compare levels on the Tor EF Scale. The scale that ranks how strong a tornado is from EF1 to EF5. However, waterspouts are not considered tornadoes and they do not have a power scale similar to tornadoes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering that tornadic waterspouts are not capable to cause much destruction, plotting them is still valuable to see just how common they are in the United States. Two maps (Figures 2 and 3) are given to see their distribution among the sharks around the coasts of the US and Hawaii. It is important to remember that these maps showcase only the more capable tornadic waterspouts. These kinds of waterspouts are the most common in Florida, while the rest of the United States lacks these specific types of events. Given they are relatively weak, rest can be assured that no sharknados can be possible from a waterspout.",

    "text": "5.2 Tornadoes that are strong enough to carry the weight of sharks do not typically form near the coasts.\nVisualization of the distribution of tornadoes shows that tornadoes with enough strength to pull sharks from the depths of the water form near enough to the coastlines to cause “shark-terror.” In the United States, EF1 and EF2 tornadoes are very common and form throughout the Midwest and Southeast the most. EF3 tornadoes appear throughout the Midwest and Southwest as well, although they are less common. These three types of tornadoes all seem to be the most common that occur on the coasts of the United States as well. EF4 and EF5 tornadoes on the other hand, are not that common (see Figure 4). In our data, there is no data recorded for an EF5 tornado, making them the least common among them all. Our analysis did not have any tornadoes appear in Hawaii (see Figure 5).\nTornadoes with less potential are more common throughout the United States. There seems to be an inverse relationship with EF Scale and Count of Tornadoes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better illustrate the EF Scale and Tornado Count Relationship (see Figure 6). Further analysis from this point on will disregard tornadoes with an EF Scale lower than or equal to 3, as these don’t have the potential to even toss cars carelessly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly considering tornadoes with an EF Score greater than 3, a clearer view at the distribution of EF4 and EF5 tornadoes show that most do not tend to form near the coastlines. There are a few exceptions, yet these still are not close enough to the ocean waters to haul sharks from their habitat (See Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems if a sharknado were to form, it would occur in the Southeast Coast, near Alabama and the Gulf of Mexico. Yet, these tornadoes are still not near enough to the ocean and any population of sharks. See Figure 8 for a closer inspection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese illustrations show that effective tornadoes are typically going to form on the coasts. In fact, the proportion of these tornadoes greater than EF3 that formed on the coastal data plotted is 0.0021142. This is from 2 tornadoes from the 473 total tornadoes that fall inside the coastline. From the entire dataset, the probabilty a tornado is greater than EF3 is 31/3831 or 0.0080919. This is just from our one sample of analysis.",

    "text": "3.2 Tornadoes and Sharks\nTo help figure out how a sharknado would be possible, the strengths and conditions of tornadoes must be analyzed to see how they could carry these apex marine predators.\n\n3.2.1 How Strong can a Tornado Be?\nThe Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which is used to assign a tornado a rating based on estimated wind speeds. The scores and their estimated wind speeds go as follows:\n\n3.2.1.1 Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale and Wind Speeds\n\n\n\nTable 1: Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale and corresponding wind speeds\n\n\nEF_Rating\nWind_Speed_Range\n\n\n\n\nEF0 (Weakest)\n65 - 85 mph\n\n\nEF1\n86 - 110 mph\n\n\nEF2\n111 - 135 mph\n\n\nEF3\n136 - 165 mph\n\n\nEF4\n166 - 200 mph\n\n\nEF5 (Strongest)\nOver 200 mph\n\n\n\n\n\nMinor damage such as broken tree branches and roof shingles being blown away can be expected from EF0 tornadoes. While on the other end of the spectrum, EF5 tornadoes can promise wind speeds that can decimate well built homes and infrastructure. These tornadoes can carry objects like cars with no trouble. An EF2 tornado is where we finally see enough force for winds to pick up a small car around 2000lbs, but not enough force for it to be thrown wildly. In the center, an EF3 tornado can remove the roofs off buildings on uproot small trees. An EF4 tornado is where we finally begin to see heavy objects such as trucks, cars, and semis be thrown around considerable distances (“Tornadoes | National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration” (n.d.)).\nAn EF5 tornado will for sure have the potential to be a sharknado, and another contender is the EF4 tornado and maybe, if the conditions are just right, an EF3 tornado might be able to, however, this is being very generous. Our sharknado would realistically have to be a category EF5 or EF4 tornado in order to cause terror similar to the film.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Tornado or Waterspout?\nThis sharknado would need to have a tornado that forms over shark infested waters. A tornado that forms over water is usually classified as a waterspout. Waterspouts are not classified as tornadoes, so they are not given a score on the EF scale. If a waterspout moves on shore however, The National Weather Service classifies it as a tornado and issues a tornado warning for the area.\nWaterspouts are generally broken into two categories: fair weather waterspouts and tornadic waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts to put it simply are a less dangerous event that form during relatively calm weather and are not associated with thunderstorms. The phenonema of interest are tornadic waterspouts. These have the same characteristics of a land tornado, they are often accompanied by high winds, severe thunderstorms, large hail (US Department of Commerce (n.d.)). It is essentially a tornado that forms over water, but it can also form by a tornado moving from land to water. If a sharknado would occur this is how it would form!\n\n\n3.2.3 Sharks in Waters in the United Sates\nSharks are found in coastal waters along the East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbeans. These waters are where a sharknado would have to form.\nSharks vary greatly in size and weight. Some common sharks and their average adult weights include (Fisheries (n.d.)) :\n\n\n\nTable 2: Shark species and typical weight ranges\n\n\nSpecies\nWeight_Range_lbs\n\n\n\n\nAtlantic Sharpnose\n15 - 25\n\n\nAtlantic Blacktip\n66 - 200\n\n\nTiger\n850 - 1400\n\n\nHammerhead\n500 - 1000\n\n\nSandtiger\n200 - 350\n\n\nThe Great White\n1500 - 2400\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sharks that were commonly seen inside the sharknado were the tiger shark, the hammerhead shark, and of course, the great white shark.",

    "text": "4.5 Comparing Waterspouts to Tornadoes\nTornadoes and waterspouts are classified as two different events. Both fit one of the requirements for a sharknado: The event must form over or near shark-inhabited waters. However, there is no simple, concrete way to measure the power scale of waterspouts. Therefore, an oversimplified way to check how much damage they are capable of is to look at the average cost of property each event has caused in our sample.\nThe following data wrangling was needed in order to get a clean chart comparing the averages. The data’s property damage column was formatted as 100K or 1M, meaning $100,000 and $1,000,000. To combat this, rows with the letters K or M in the “DAMAGE_PROPERTY” column were multiplied by 1000 and 10000000. This prepared the property damage to be averaged out and listed in a chart using ggplot() from the ggplot2 packge.",

Some implications such as tornado points that fall on the borders will arise from this however.\nThe tornadoes coordinate data points were joined with the coastal spatial data polygons. The tornado points were transformed into spatial data via st_transform() from the ‘sf’ package. Then with the st_join() from the same package, we can finally filter all the points inside the coastal regions like we want. Here, the observed proportion of EF4 and EF5 tornadoes on the coasts was also found and it will be shown in the results.\n\n\n4.8.2 Bootstrap Histogram\nA histogram is made to show the distribution of the bootstrapped proportions, with a red dashed line showing the mean of these samples.

Waterspouts do tend to form in shark infested waters, but these are not powerful enough to lift sharks that can weight up to 2400 lbs and relocate them to land. From the more powerful of the two types of waterspouts, tornadic waterspouts’ power are limited and never seem to make landfall.",

    "text": "6.2 There is a Little Amount of Tornadoes with a High Enough EF Score that form near the coasts\nTornadoes that do form near the coasts typically have an EF rating of EF2 or lower, with the occasional EF3. An EF2 tornado has the power to lift a car and move it from where it was, but when trying to find the possibility of lifting sharks throughout a city, a stronger EF4 tornado is very well needed to pull the sharks from the depths of the water. Although there are some EF3 tornadoes present in Florida, and EF3 tornadoes could pick up a car and throw them a considerable distance, these are not capable of producing a storm where sharks, like the Great Whites and Hammerheads in the films, are thrown violently. There is an EF4 tornado located in Georgia, however this tornado is not close enough to the ocean coasts that it would be able to make contact with the sharks present there.\n\n6.2.1 Assuming Perfect Conditions, it is Still Unlikely that Capable Tornadoes can Form Close Enough to the Coasts to become Sharknados\nUnder the drastic assumption that all EF4 or higher tornadoes that form within the data’s coastal perimeters will become sharknados, a long run average of r mean_boot is calculated. This means given perfect conditions and EF Scales being randomized with replacement, sharknados will form 0.10% of the time. We do not have enough evidence to state that sharknados are a probable threat in the near future, based on our tornado data from 2020-2025.",

    "text": "6.4 Limitations in Data and Knowledge\n\n6.4.1 No Free Shark Survey Dataset (From a Trusted Source) that Has Observations on the West Coast or Northeast of America\nAlthough our data showed that tornadic waterspouts and tornadoes that form near the coasts of America do not form too often and are not that powerful, there was not much comparison when plotting those events against sharks surveyed or spotted outside of the Southeast or Hawaii. Data for California was found, however that was not survey or tracking data, rather it was shark incident data. This leads to more sharks being plotted in places that have more people, preventing an evenly distribution of shark points on the map. Due to this limitation, our interpretation can only be justified that people on the coasts of the Southeast region of America near the Gulf of Mexico, Hawaii, and California.\n\n\n6.4.2 Bootstrapping\nOur probability observed from our bootstrapped sample of 0.0010, truly only tells us that if the EF scales of the tornadoes in our dataset were randomized, this is the long run proportion of EF4 and EF5 tornadoes that will form near the coasts. However, the way the coastal data is set up, these tornadoes can be technically in the coastal region plotted, but be too far away from the coastline to be able to cause havoc with sharks.\nStill regarding this, perfect conditions are assumed, and given there is no way based on the datasets collected to measure the probability of sharks being near the surface, this bootstrapped probability is only theoretical but it could be truly higher or lower.\n\n\n6.4.3 Hurricanes?\nIn this report, only tornadoes were considered. This can be a bit problematic when looking at a place like the Southeast. It could be argued, that a hurricane of great strength could be enough to lift the numerous sharks surrounding Hawaii, but in as stated previous, we are not interested in Shark-icanes.\n\n\n6.4.4 Comparing Tornadoes and Waterspouts\nWaterspouts do not have any classification of power similar to tornadoes. In order to compare the differences in power between the two, the observed damage to property was looked at. A problem with this is that waterspouts will most likely be less damaging as they are not near much property at all when forming. This caused the averages to be compared instead, but there is still some limitations on how far the implication of just how strong waterspouts can be. It is clear though, that the greatest waterspouts, were still not able to match the power of tornadoes with a score of EF2 or higher.",
