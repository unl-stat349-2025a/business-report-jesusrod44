# Overview

This document summarizes several shark, tornado, and coastal datasets used to investigate spatial relationships between tornado-prone regions, shark distributions, and coastal areas. It describes the origin, purpose, structure, and limitations of each dataset.

## Shark Data

Four shark datasets were used in this business report. Three come from trusted government agencies and report a survey of sharks tagged in the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and Hawaii. The fourth one differs from the rest, being that it is data recorded on shark incidents in California.

### Blacktip Shark Biological Data (2008–2010)

Source: NOAA InPort

Collected by: Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

Purpose: To study the foraging ecology of juvenile blacktip sharks in Florida and assess resource overlap

Coverage: Crooked Island Sound and Gulf of Mexico side of St. Vincent Island, Florida

Period: 2008–2010

Data Format: .csv file with separate columns for Day, Month, and Year

Structure: Biological and diet information of sharks, recorded through gillnets and longlines

Data Quality:

-   Government source (NOAA); some missing values

-   No listed license or use restrictions

### NMFS Bottom Longline Survey Data (2010–2024)

Source: Data.gov

Collected by: SEFSC, NOAA

Purpose: To provide standardized, fisheries-independent data on sharks, snappers, and groupers

Coverage: U.S. Southeast and Gulf of Mexico

Period: 2010–2024

Data Format: Excel .xlsx file

Structure: Scientific names, measurements, weights, life history traits

Collection Method: Bottom longline surveys (day and night); sharks tagged or sampled

### Hawaii Tiger Shark Tracking Data (2016–Present)

Source: Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System (PACIOOS)

Collected by: PACIOOS

Purpose: To monitor the movement of tiger sharks using satellite tags

Coverage: Hawaii coastal waters

Period: 2016–Present

### California Shark Incident Database (1950–2022)

Source: data.ca.gov

Collected by: California Department of Fish and Wildlife

Purpose: To document shark incidents along California coasts

Coverage: California coastal waters

Period: 1950–2022

-   Details: Human activity, injury, depth, location, and source Data Quality:
-   Public dataset with no usage restrictions
-   Some incidents have unknown species recorded

## Tornado Data

Five datasets from the past 5 years, each containing information for a different year, were analyzed in this report. All datasets were taken from the same source.

### NOAA Sotrm Events Data (2020-2025)

Source: NOAA Storm Events Database

Collected by: National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), NOAA

Purpose: To track tornado-related damage and conditions in the U.S.

## Coastal Data

Only one dataset for coastal data was utilized in this report.

### U.S. Coastal Zone Management Counties (2009)

Source: USGS Open File Report 2013-1284

-   Includes polygons with latitude/longitude of each coastal county

Data Quality:

-   Government dataset

-   No specific liscense given
