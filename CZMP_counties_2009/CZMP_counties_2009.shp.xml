<abstract>
Shapefile for 492 Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) counties and county equivalents, 2009, extracted from the U.S. Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER database of U.S. counties and cross-referenced to a list of CZMP counties published by the NOAA/NOS Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM). Data extent to the nearest quarter degree is 141.00 E to 64.50 W longitude and 14.75 S to 71.50 N latitude.

TL2009 in this document refers to metadata content inherited from the original U.S. Census Bureau (2009) TIGER/Line shapefile.

TL2009: The TIGER/Line Shapefiles are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census MAF/TIGER database. The Census MAF/TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each TIGER/Line Shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent dataset or the shapefiles can be combined to cover the whole nation.
</abstract>
<purpose>
These polygons are provided as criteria for selecting georeferenced data from other databases. The precision of geographic searches in any system that employs these polygons will depend on the nature of the search algorithm.

This information is not intended for navigational purposes.

These data are intended for science researchers, students, policymakers, and the general public. The data can be used with geographic information systems (GIS) software to display geologic and oceanographic information.

TL2009: In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.
</purpose>
<supplinf>
The U.S. Census Bureau publishes density, land-use, and socio-economic information at various geographic scales (national, state, territory). Information on coastal zone counties is increasingly important as human growth, development, and reliance increases on coastal resources. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) provides important information on the preservation, protection, and management of the nation's coastal resources (&lt;http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/czm/czm_act.html&gt;). Implemented through the NOAA/NOS Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), the Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) includes "those counties that are wholly or partially within the boundaries of a state's approved coastal management program" (&lt;http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/success/media/contextualindicatormanual.pdf&gt;).

The attributes for the USGS product are adapted from the attributes for the Census Bureau product.

U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Spatial Extents for Marine Gazetteers project.

Project leaders:

Frances L. Lightsom, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP), Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center (flightsom@usgs.gov)

Alan O. Allwardt, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP), Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center (aallwardt@usgs.gov)

Project background:

Gazetteers of terrestrial and marine regions, including the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), GEOnet Names Server (GNS), GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names, and VLIZ Marine Gazetteer (VLIMAR), generally provide single-point locations or rectangular bounding boxes for named features, because the primary function of these gazetteers is to standardize geographic name usage. Many geospatial information services, however, would be improved if the authoritative place names from these gazetteers were associated with polygons representing the actual spatial extents of the features in question.

The USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP) has created and compiled shapefiles to facilitate the retrieval of georeferenced information resources related to named oceans and seas, undersea features, coastal features and waterways, and relevant administrative areas including the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) counties. Geospatial information systems with the capability for searching user-defined, polygonal geographic areas will be able to utilize these shapefiles or secondary products derived from them, such as well-known text (WKT) representations of the individual polygons within the shapefiles.

CMGP and its collaborators would benefit from improvements in the gazetteers for these existing and planned geospatial information services:

1. The CMGP Knowledge Management Project provides online geospatial search services for research data and scientific information (for example, CMG InfoBank and CMGDS). These geospatial search services currently employ simple map interfaces and/or gazetteers with rectangular bounding boxes for spatial extents.

2. The internal USGS Geospatial Management Information System (GMIS) has a gazetteer with polygons for locating field studies on land, but it offers little aid for offshore searches, where many CMGP investigations are conducted.

3. Information services for two interagency initiatives, marine planning (&lt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oceans/cmsp&gt;) and the Ocean and Coastal Mapping (OCM) Inventory (&lt;http://iocm.noaa.gov/iwg/&gt;), are under development and could incorporate spatially enhanced coastal and marine gazetteers.

In this context, the primary purpose of including spatial extents for the place names in a gazetteer is to assist information retrieval, rather than to establish precise boundaries.

Planned project products, compiled for incorporation into gazetteers:

1. Major ocean and sea boundaries (as defined by IHO and VLIMAR), incorporated into USGS gazetteers.

2. Defined spatial extents for high-priority undersea features, incorporated into the GEBCO Gazetteer (in collaboration with Lisa A. Taylor and John C. Cartwright, NOAA/NGDC/MGGD).

3. Spatial extents of named high-priority U.S. coastal features and waterways, incorporated into an authoritative gazetteer.

4. Spatial extents of relevant U.S. administrative areas, including the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), National Marine Sanctuaries, and Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) counties.

Project results:

The project will improve communication about coastal and marine activities, and enhance usability and interoperability of geospatial data services. The project will lay a foundation for future improvements by demonstrating formats and systems that can be used for incorporating additional spatial extents into marine gazetteers.

Project outcome:

People will be more successful in using familiar place names when they are looking for USGS projects and information, and other Federally funded geospatial information, about coastal and offshore features.

Project objective:

To generate a set of databases, in a standard format, that use polygons to define the spatial extents of named oceans and seas, undersea features, coastal features and waterways, and relevant administrative areas.

Polygon topology present.

TL2009: The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of shapefiles. Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area. All polygons are tested for closure.

The Census Bureau uses its internally developed geographic update system to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census MAF/TIGER database. Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian areas, and congressional districts are used when encoding spatial entities. The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census MAF/TIGER database files. Most of the codes for geographic entities except states, counties, urban areas, Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), American Indian Areas (AIAs), and congressional districts were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.

For the TIGER/Line Shapefiles, the Point and Vector Object Count for the G-polygon SDTS Point and Vector Object Type reflects the number of records in the shapefile attribute table. For multi-polygon features, only one attribute record exists for each multi-polygon rather than one attribute record per individual G-polygon component of the multi-polygon feature. TIGER/Line Shapefile multi-polygons are an exception to the G-polygon object type classification. Therefore, when multi-polygons exist in a shapefile, the object count will be less than the actual number of G-polygons.

The TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted, however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau. These products are free to use in a product or publication, however acknowledgement must be given to the U.S. Census Bureau as the source. The boundary information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles are for statistical data collection and tabulation purposes only; their depiction and designation for statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional authority or rights of ownership or entitlement and they are not legal land descriptions. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line shapefiles have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest.

Additional aspects of the TIGER/Line shapefiles were clarified in a written communication from the U.S. Census Bureau to the USGS project leaders:

"We refer to the seaward limit of water in the TIGER/Line shapefiles as the 3-mile limit. This 3-mile limit serves to define the outer limit of coverage by the MAF/TIGER database. Our 3-mile limit does not represent any sort of formal legal or administrative boundary and is not intended to define official limits for Federal programs or legal disputes even though it is often very similar to the Submerged Lands Act boundary. In most areas, our 3-mile limit is approximately 3 nautical miles out to sea (or ocean), and is similar (but not identical) to the old limit of the United States' territorial waters (before the limit of territorial waters changed from 3 to 12 nautical miles in 1988). While our 3-mile limit has not been substantially modified since the creation of our TIGER Database, we are currently looking into possible modifications/improvements for the future to make it more consistent with other Federal limits" (Geographic Products Branch, Geography Division, U.S. Census Bureau, written communication to Alan O. Allwardt dated 13 June 2011).

Wingfield identified 491 CZMP counties and county equivalents, represented by 500 polygons, using a three-step process: 1) the 2008 TIGER/Line shapefile (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008) provided shapefile information for all counties and county equivalents in the 50 states, District of Columbia, and U.S. territories; 2) Appendix A of the Coastal Zone Management Act Performance Measurement System: Contextual Indicators Manual (NOAA/NOS/OCRM, 2009) was used to create a subset of the TIGER/Line shapefile for CZMP counties and county equivalents; and 3) this subset was reconciled as necessary with Substantial Changes to Counties and County Equivalent Entities: 1970-Present (U.S. Census Bureau, undated).

Hartwell updated the CZMP counties shapefile to conform with the 2009 TIGER/Line shapefile (U.S. Census Bureau, 2009) by using the ArcGIS "select by location" command: the 2009 TIGER/Line polygons were selected if their centroids were contained within one of the polygons of the 2008 CZMP counties shapefile; all other polygons within the 2009 TIGER/Line shapefile were eliminated, thus producing an updated CZMP counties shapefile (now with 492 CZMP counties and county equivalents, represented by 501 polygons).

Subsequent changes in CZMP participation (for example, the voluntary withdrawal of Alaska in 2011) are not reflected in the shapefile.
