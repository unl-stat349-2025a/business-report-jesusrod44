# Purpose

The Sharknado film series takes the idea of tornadoes picking up marine life to a dramatic extreme. While there has not been a documented case of a tornado hurling sharks onto land, we explored whether such an event is even scientifically plausible. We examined whether powerful tornadoes could form over or near coastal shark-infested waters enough for them to become sharknados.

# Evalutation

To assess the likelihood of a tornado capturing sharks within its vortex and terrorizing the public, we analyzed tornado data from 2020 to 2025 and shark data near U.S. coastlines, particularly around the Gulf of Mexico. We defined two key measurable conditions that are required for a Sharknado to occur: (1) a tornado must be strong enough to lift a shark and (2) it must form over or near shark-inhabited waters.

Tornadoes, waterspouts, sharks, and shark incidents were plotted on a map and the coasts of the United States were highlighted to better illustrate them. 

# Findings 

Our findings indicate that waterspouts, tornadoes that form over water, are generally weaker than their land-based counterparts and are unlikely to lift large animals such as sharks. Tornadoes on the other hand, only two types of tornadoes have the potential to lift sharks from the water, these are EF4 and EF5 tornadoes. These tornadoes typically do not form directly over shark-infested waters or in close proximity to coasts of the Unites States. Even under theoretically perfect conditions, a proportion of 1000 bootstrapped samples based on the tornado data collected from 2020-2025 from NOAA, we get an observed bootstrap average of 0.0081.

# Reccomendations

The Sharknado scenario remains a thrilling fictional concept, luckily, the probability of such an event occurring any time soon in real life is extremely low. People can be rest assured. There is no immenent threat of tornadoes hurling sharks from skies.
